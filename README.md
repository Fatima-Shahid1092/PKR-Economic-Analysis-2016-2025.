# The Slow Disappearance of Value: A Forensic Analysis of PKR Purchasing Power (2016–2025)
### Project Overview

This project measures how inflation quietly eroded the real purchasing power of the Pakistani Rupee over a decade.
Using CPI-based quantitative analysis across 120 months (2016–2025), the study tracks structural decay patterns and identifies critical inflationary shocks, including the 2024 peak.

### ​Key Quantitative Findings


- Utility Decay: A 64.06% reduction in real-world purchasing power since the 2016 benchmark.


- Phase III Shock: Analyzed the critical collapse and "Sudden Fall" occurring between Jan 2023 and Dec 2025.


### Technical Implementation

- Data Processing: Python (Pandas)

- Data Validation and Calculation: Microsoft Excel. Used for raw PBS/SBP datasets and calculating cumulative decay metrics(file uploaded here(purchasing power)

- ​Forensic Modeling: 120-month longitudinal decay tracking.


- Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn.
