# The Slow Disappearance of Value: A Forensic Analysis of PKR Purchasing Power (2016–2025)
### Project Overview


​This repository contains a 120-month longitudinal forensic analysis investigating the structural decay of the Pakistani Rupee (PKR).
Using quantitative modeling and CPI datasets, this study identifies critical "Structural Fractures" and the 2024 record inflation peak of 30.0%.

### ​Key Quantitative Findings


- Utility Decay: A 64.06% reduction in real-world purchasing power since the 2016 benchmark.


- Phase III Shock: Analyzed the "Sudden Fall" and critical collapse occurring between Jan 2023 and Feb 2024.


### Technical Implementation


- Data Processing: Python (Pandas).


- Visualization: High-fidelity data mapping using Matplotlib and Seaborn.


-  ​Forensic Modeling: 120-month longitudinal decay tracking.
